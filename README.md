# 🏏 Player Management System (Java + Hibernate + MySQL)

A full-stack **Java Web Application** built using **Servlets, JSP, Hibernate (JPA), and MySQL** to manage cricket players. Tables are auto-generated using `persistence.xml` and annotated Entity classes (no manual SQL table creation needed).

---

## 📁 Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Java Servlets, Hibernate (JPA)
- **Frontend**: JSP, HTML, CSS
- **Database**: MySQL (Tables auto-created via Entity classes)
- **ORM Tool**: Hibernate with `persistence.xml`
- **IDE**: Eclipse (Maven Project)
- **Build Tool**: Maven

## 🔧 Features

- Add New Players
- View All Players
- Auto Table Creation using Hibernate
- Clean MVC Structure (Servlet → DAO → Entity)
- Easy Deployment using Apache Tomcat

## 🧪 Database Setup

- ✅ No need to manually create tables in MySQL.
- Hibernate auto-generates the table from your `Player` entity when the app runs.
- Make sure you update `persistence.xml` with your DB username and password.
